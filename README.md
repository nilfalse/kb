# What is “KB?”
> “KB” stands for Knowledge Base.

The project aims at gathering information about  very specific, tech-related topics in one place.

Unlike ordinary weblogs, one should consider a post in Knowledge Base being up to date at any given time.
Hence, the only immutable thing in a post is its URL.

The project is maintained by [Yaroslav @nilfalse](https://nilfalse.com/) but contributions from community are always welcome.
